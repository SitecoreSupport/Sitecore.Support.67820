# Sitecore.Support.67820
The `forms:selectplaceholders` command may be executed slowly due to not optimized query that runs to get placeholders with allowed controls in the `Web Forms for Marketers` module.<br/>
This patch optimizes the mentioned query to improve performance when using the `Restricting Placeholders` dialog box.
